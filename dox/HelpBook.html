<h1>JarBundler - &lt;HelpBook...&gt; Nested Task</h1>

<h2>Including an Apple Help Book</h2>

<p>Documentation for creating Apple Help Book support can be found 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1022.html">here</a>.
Basically one needs to specify both the HelpBook directory name and the Help Book name. The application
<strong>must</strong> also have a unique Bundle ID so that the Help Viewer can reference the application.

The Help Book itself consists of pure HTML files, images, and optional CSS styling. This is easy
to create and develop outside of the application.  The "Hello, World" Help Book HTML can be used as a
starter or checkout any application exiting Help Book folder now that you know where to find it.

<p>The Help Book viewer does <strong>not</strong> automatcially open the file named <tt>index.html</tt>
as does a web server.  The root file <strong>must</strong> contain a META tag specifing the 
name <tt>AppleTitle</tt>. The content of this tag must match the value specified in the 
<tt>helpbookname</tt> attributer of the <tt>jarbundler</tt> task.
This META tag is used to both designate the root HTML file and its
content is used by the Help Viewer in its "Library" listing.</p>

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
         .
         .
     &lt;meta name="AppleTitle" content="Hello World Help"/&gt;
         .
         .
  &lt;/head&gt;

</pre>

<p>Finally, one needs a JNI library to communicate between the "Help" menu item and the "Help Book 
Viewer" or whichever application is being used to render Help Book help.  
This is a very simple file and usage is demonstrated in the "Hello, World" example.
Windows and Linux users will not be able to generate the JNI library on their platforms.
In order to generate a univeral binary JNI you can use Xcode and the tutorial found
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/jniuniversal.html">here</a>. 



<pre style="padding-left:3em; margin-bottom:0em;">
&lt;jarbundler dir="${basedir}"
                      .
                      .
                      .
            helpbookfolder="HelpBook"
            helpbookname="Hello World Help" &gt; 
                 
  &lt;!-- Copy the HelpBook JNI library  --&gt;
  &lt;javafilelist dir="${basedir}/build" files="libHelpBookJNI.jnilib"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Specify the HelpBook contents --&gt;   
  &lt;helpbook&gt;
     &lt;fileset dir="${basedir}/HelpBook"/&gt;
  &lt;helpbook/&gt;
                     
&lt;/jarbundler&gt;
    
</pre>



<pre style="padding-left:3em; margin-bottom:0em;">
&lt;jarbundler dir="${basedir}"
                      .
                      .
                      .
            helpbookfolder="HelpBook"
            helpbookname="Hello World Help" &gt; 
                      .
                      .
                      .
  &lt;helpbook locale="English"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="HelpBook/English" /&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="HelpBook/common" /&gt;
  &lt;/helpbook&gt;
      
  &lt;helpbook foldername="Hilfebuch" name="Hallo Welt Hilfe" locale="German"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="HelpBook/German" /&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="HelpBook/common" /&gt;
  &lt;/helpbook&gt;
  
  &lt;helpbook name="Hjälp" locale="sv"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="HelpBook/Swedish" /&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="HelpBook/common" /&gt;
  &lt;/helpbook&gt;
  
&lt;/jarbundler&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Troubleshooting the Help Viewer cache.</h3> 
<p>During development the Help Viewer sometimes 
refuses to update the contents of a Help Book which changed.  The Apple Developer Docs
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2005/qa1409.html">suggest</a> to delete or 
edit the file <tt>~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.help.plist</tt>.  This file
contains the list of known Help Books.  If you double-click on this file the XML Property Editor
applicaiton will be launched and re can 'delete' your bundle ID entry and "save" this file.  Deleting
this file does no harm but is a less elegant way to deal with the problem.

<p>This document also suggests deleting the
folder <tt>~/Library/Caches/com.apple.helpui</tt> to help with refresh problem during development.

<h3>Future Help Book development in JarBundler</h3>
<p>This Help Book creation technique should work for 90% of the Java applications desiring Help 
Book support.  The nested tag <tt>&lt;resourcefileset&gt;</tt> can be used to move localized
Help Books into their proper 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1022.html">location</a>.  
At some point a <tt>&lt;helpbook&gt;</tt> task may be added to facilitate deploying 
multilingual Help Books.
